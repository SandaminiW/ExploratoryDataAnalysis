# ExploratoryDataAnalysis
Exploratory Data Analysis Using Python

## Project Overview
This project focuses on conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset titled "TWO CENTURIES OF UM RACES." The goal is to uncover insights by cleaning and preparing the data, followed by analyzing key variables. Various data preprocessing steps, such as cleaning athlete names, standardizing performance data, and handling missing values, are applied to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis. Visualizations, descriptive statistics, and correlation analysis are utilized to identify trends and relationships within the data. This project aims to provide a better understanding of race performances and the factors influencing outcomes over time.

## Final Conclusion 
Through the exploratory data analysis, the project successfully cleaned and processed the dataset for further analysis. Key findings suggest significant patterns in race performances over time, with athlete age and event type being notable factors in outcomes. The visualizations provide a clearer understanding of the distribution and trends in the data, highlighting areas where performance has varied across different eras and locations. Overall, this analysis provides a strong foundation for more advanced statistical modeling or predictive analysis, should the need arise in future stages of research. â€‹
